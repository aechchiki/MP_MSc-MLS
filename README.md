Master Project

Group: Marc Robinson-Rechavi. Supervisor: Julien Roux.

Project: Using long read sequencing technologies to improve the study of alternative splicing. 

Description: The aim of the project is to make use of RNA-seq data generated with long read sequencing (PacBio RSII and Oxford Nanopore MinION) in combination to more classical short read sequencing (Illumina HiSeq), to study the patterns of alternative splicing at an unprecedented resolution. The experimental approach will focus on the choice of appropriate analyzing tools and the development of a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the produced dataset. Programming tasks (Perl, Linux shell scripting), statistical data analysis (R) and pertinent biological interpretation are envisaged. 

Additional information: The Master project is a research project offered by the School of Biology to Master Students. It takes place in the second and third semesters. It's a major research project that provides students with the opportunity to work at the frontiers of knowledge in their field.
